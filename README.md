**Udacity A/B test on a screener feature**

**Background**

Udacity's mission is centered around bridging the gap between learning and career advancement by offering accessible, high-quality and industry-relevent education. This task on Udacity website is to test a idea to improve user experience when student clicked on "start free trial"

**Statu quo**

  Students have two options on the course: start free trial or access course materials
  Start free trial: students will enter their credit card information and they will have access to the paid course. After 14 days, the card will charged automatically unless they cancel first
  Access course materials: students will have access to view videos and quizzes for free but they will not receive support or verified certificate.
  
**Treatment**

  If a student clicked on "start free trial", they were asked how much time they has available to devote to the course.
  If the student indicated 5 or more hours per week, they would be taken through a checkout process where they entered their credit card information.
  For the student who indicated fewer than 5 hours per week, a message would show to suggest the student might like to access the materials for free
  
**Goal**

  This is trying to improve the overall student experience and improve the support capacity for students are likely to complete courses by reducing the number of frustrated students who did not have enough time to complete the course
